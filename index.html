   <h1>This is the DOM and Events Lecture Web Page</h1>

   <p> The DOM has a lot of layers to it. 
      The first thing we need to focus on is the
       <strong>window</strong> object.</p>

   <p>Let's try to add Javascript that changes the 
      color of this text in the p tag to be 
      red when we hover over it?</p>
